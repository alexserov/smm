I think it's called "Responsive design" =)

sublevel behavior

TODO

a) I have also an idea to hide a cursor when clicking on any menu item and navigate by changing the highlighted item: thus cursor will not move, and MAYBE it will be easier to select any item. In this case the left mouse button will be used to invoke a command (as usual) BUT the right button will navigate us to the previous menu level (or exiting from menu if we're on the top of it), we can also exit navigation mode by clicking the escape buton.

b) in case of this kind of menu we can create various item types: menus\checks\buttons and also some editors like listboxes and maybe galleries; I think all of these kinds will be well-looking in this menu. 

c) for the touch mode we can use some gestures like swipe to return to the previous level and so on. Anyway it seems to be compatible with the touch interaction as well as with the mouse interaction.

d) after some discussion with Max L. : he suggested this as some properties in the TileNavPane control to extend its logic + add docking feature to the TNP control.
